    <b>Diana Peterson</b>
    <p>I am a beginner fashion model and do not yet have much experience in commercial
        shootings. Ryan has a unique way of making you feel comfortable in the frame.
        He does a great job of finding the best location,providing,direction and listening to your wishes.
